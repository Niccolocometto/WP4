/**
 * EventBuffers store Events of a template type T, these events can be written in O(1) time and read asynchronously without
 * using dynamic memory.
 *
 * The main data structure behind the EventBuffer is a circular array. Events are read by EventReaders but they are never
 * deleted from the buffer, only overwritten as the buffer fills up. All readers subscribed to the buffers will read every
 * event written to it, assuming they are preempted enough to read them all. Thus readers must be preempted sufficient times such
 * that events are read at an equal or faster pace than they are written.
 *
 * To ensure data integrity, writing and reading operations are encapsulated in two different objects. Thus it becomes
 * possible to guarantee that readers cannot accidentally write into a buffer.
 *
 * Reading operations are accomplished by two classes, both are child of the IEventReader Interface.The readers are meant
 * to be used in a monitor, which periodically wakes up to check the monitored application code is functioning correctly.
 *  - EventReader: reads events in a FIFO order.
 *  - SynchronizedEventReader: reads events events that are larger than a synchronization timestamp variable, shared
 *  between different buffers in FIFO order; this event reader is meant to be used inside a Monitor.
 *
 * Writing operations are done by a single EventWriter class, where all operations take constant O(1) time. Thus writing
 * will always take the same time. This makes the timing analysis of the application deterministic and not dependent on
 * how many readers are present in the buffer, full timing isolation for the writer is achieved.
 *
 * The class also uses a template parameter to define its size, thus avoiding the use of dynamic memory with a clean
 * design. However this template parameter also has the disadvantage of burdening the user with the exact same size
 * declaration whenever he wants to use it. To avoid this a superclass name IEventBuffer was created.
 *
 * To avoid cyclic dependency where the EventBuffer needs to know readers and writers, and those need to know the EventBuffer,
 * a Buffer class was created. The buffer class contains the data readers and writers need and also defines some common
 * operations such as atomic writing elements to the buffer, or atomically reading an index.

<p><span>RM</span> are mechanisms provided to establish amounts of shared resources to be consumed by working tasks in <span>RTS</span>s. Normally, these mechanisms focus on time consumption and ensure <em>time isolation</em> between different tasks or sets of tasks. <em>Periodic <span>RM</span></em> are defined by their <em>replenishment period</em> and <em>budget supply</em>. Budgets are dynamically available as the time elapses and are replenished at certain defined periods. <em>Elastic <span>RM</span></em> are an extension of periodic <span>RM</span> containing <em>elastic coefficients</em>, similar to <span><em>spring coefficients</em></span> in physics. They describe how the execution time of a task can be temporally deflated or inflated by applying n-D geometric region constraints (polynomial inequalities) over resource budgets. These restricted coefficients allow for the system’s under-load and over-load to be controlled. Spring coefficients, which are seen as logic variables, define the rate (or constraint) of inflation and deflation of a resource (in our case, processing time) and can be changed during execution. In this use case, these coefficients are governed by linear inequality constraints which dictate the under- and over-loading conditions of a certain set of tasks.</p>
<p>Consider the formula <span><span class="math">\[0 \leq a\times \int^{\pi_1} \psi_1 + b\times \int^{\pi_2} \psi_2 \leq \frac{1}{4}\theta\]</span></span>that specifies the resource constraints of two <span>RM</span> where coefficients are managed according to the linear equation <span class="math">\(a=1-b\)</span> for <span class="math">\(a,b \geq \frac{1}{4}\)</span>, that <span class="math">\(\psi_1\)</span>,<span class="math">\(\psi_2\)</span> are two formulas describing the event releases of two distinct tasks, and that <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> is the allowed execution time for the <span>RM</span>. Informally, the formula specifies that both resource models have different budgets when both execute at the same time, which in practice is the case when both <span>RM</span>s interfere in the system. To find the conditions for monitoring we need to quantify the formula, yielding a new formula</p>
<p><span class="math">\(
\exists _{\{a,b\}}\left(a=1-b\land a&gt;\frac{1}{4}\land b&gt;\frac{1}{4}\land 0 \leq a\times \int^{\pi_1} \psi_1 + b\times \int^{\pi_2} \psi_2 \leq \frac{\theta}{4}\right).
\)</span></p>
<p>Later, after applying the simplification algorithm described in <span class="citation"></span>, we generate the monitoring conditions from Example [ex:durational], as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{aligned}
&amp;\scriptstyle( \int^{\pi_1} \psi_1=0\land 0\leq \int^{\pi_2} \psi_2&lt;\theta )&amp;\lor \ \ &amp;\scriptstyle\left(0&lt;\int^{\pi_1} \psi_1&lt;\frac{\theta }{4}\land 0\leq \int^{\pi_2} \psi_2&lt;\theta -3 \int^{\pi_1} \psi_1\right)&amp;\lor \\
&amp;\scriptstyle\left(\int^{\pi_1} \psi_1=\frac{\theta }{4}\land 0\leq \int^{\pi_2} \psi_2\leq \frac{\theta }{4}\right)&amp;\lor \ \ &amp;\scriptstyle\left(\frac{\theta }{4}&lt;\int^{\pi_1} \psi_1&lt;\frac{\theta }{3}\land 0\leq \int^{\pi_2} \psi_2&lt;\frac{\theta -\int^{\pi_1} \psi_1}{3}\right)&amp;\lor \\
&amp;\scriptstyle\left(\int^{\pi_1} \psi_1=\frac{\theta }{3}\land \theta -3 \int^{\pi_1} \psi_1\leq \int^{\pi_2} \psi_2&lt;\frac{\theta -\int^{\pi_1} \psi_1}{3}\right)&amp;\lor \ \ &amp;\scriptstyle\left(\frac{\theta }{3}&lt;\int^{\pi_1} \psi_1&lt;\theta \land 0\leq \int^{\pi_2} \psi_2&lt;\frac{\theta -\int^{\pi_1} \psi_1}{3}\right),\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\psi_1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\psi_2\)</span> are both simplified formulas.</p>
<p>In Figure [fig:regionsample] we can see regions where the <span>RM</span>s are able to consume resources or not. For instance, the resource <span class="math">\(B\)</span> cannot consume any resource if resource <span class="math">\(A\)</span> consumes <span class="math">\(10\)</span> units, and the resource <span class="math">\(A\)</span> can only consume more than <span class="math">\(4\)</span> units if the resource <span class="math">\(B\)</span> consumes less than <span class="math">\(2\)</span> time units, due to resource constraints. For the case of both resources consuming <span class="math">\(2.5\)</span> units each, the difference between the sum and the execution time indicates that the interference of both resource models executing concurrently is at most <span class="math">\(5\)</span> time units (it is identified by the hashed region). Intuitively, this constraint means that one resource needs to be deflated when the other resource is inflated and conversely. Note that different regions can be found by modifying the constraints of the scale factor <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{4}\)</span>, or any of the <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a\)</span> or <span class="math">\(b\)</span> parameters.</p>
